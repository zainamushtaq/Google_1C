## Machine Learning Problem: Predicting Flu Outbreaks

**Objective**: Predict flu outbreaks in a specific state during the winter season based on Google Search trends.

- **Threshold**: An outbreak is considered when more than 20% of the state's population tests positive for the flu.

### Key Features:
1. **Google Search Trends**: Track searches for flu symptoms, remedies, vaccines, and related terms like “fever,” “cold,” or “urgent care” to provide early indicators.
2. **Seasonal Factors**: Events like Christmas, which involve increased travel and gatherings, as well as environmental factors like cold weather and snow, which may contribute to flu spread.
3. **State-Specific Safety Precautions**: Varying health measures implemented by different states to prevent flu outbreaks (e.g., mask mandates, social distancing).
4. **Vaccination Rates**: State-level vaccination rates for the current flu season.
5. **Historical Flu Data**: Past flu outbreaks in the state to identify patterns and trends.

### Additional Features to Consider:
- **Access to Healthcare**: Availability of healthcare services such as hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies that provide flu vaccines and treatments.
- **Access to Medicine**: State-level data on flu vaccine distribution and availability of over-the-counter medications.
- **Demographic Data**: Age distribution and population density, as certain demographics are more vulnerable to the flu.
- **Travel Data**: Levels of domestic or international travel to/from the state, as high travel may contribute to flu spread.
- **Weather Data**: More detailed weather patterns (e.g., temperature drops, humidity levels) that could influence flu transmission.
